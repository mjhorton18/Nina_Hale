		<h2><u>Professional Profile</u></h2>
		<br>
		<p>My first love has always been efficiency. Out of that grew my love of science, farming, art, marketing, and event planning. These seemingly unconnected fields may give my resume and awkward hue, but it is the puzzle-side of my brain that drives all 4. 
		Nina Hale is unmatched in integrated digial stategies and you have the results to show for it. I would be honored to join the Nina Hale team as the Digital Paid Media Intern.
